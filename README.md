### HELLO THERE  üëã

Thanks for passing by. My name is Mark, and I am a frontend developer, with a of backend physique. I build stuff for web and mobile.

This project is my solution for a challenge on Frontend Mentor.

Advice Generator is a simple frontend application generates a new advice by making an API call each time the dice button is clicked. 

See the final application here [Advice Generator App](https://malonzy.github.io/advice-generator/)



### ON A NOT-SO-SERIOUS NOTE üßê

There are a couple of things I would love to have your thoughts about:

* How intuitive is the application to you?

* How can I improve this application?

* How close enough to the challenge is my application? Check out the challenge here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db

* On a score of 0-10, what would you rate me based on this application.

* Any other thoughts relevant to this application?



If by chance you have any app ideas, I'll be so glad to throw in a helping hand, or probably take it on. Cheers
